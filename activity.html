            <h2> ANGELITO L. NUNEZ</h2>
            <p> Turtle Tuck is a very sensitive young turtle. 
                He is the heart of the group and he has a deep emotional connection to all living things. Tuck loves to give and receive hugs. 
                Developmentally, Tuck is a four-year-old. He is the least physically advanced of the Wonder Pets. 
                He is, however, an excellent swimmer and demonstrates keen observational skills while out on their adventures.!                                               </p>

            <p> Linny the Guinea Pig is the groupâ€™s leader. 
                Linny is the brains of the outfit, a fearless guinea pig who will do anything to help a fellow creature in need. 
                She represents the developmental age of a five-year-old and is also the oldest of the Wonder Pets. 
                Linny reminds her fellow creatures to value teamwork and trust. Her favorite food is celery.                                                                    </p>

            <h2> BHEBIE JANE C. MIRAS </h2>
            <p> Ming-Ming Duckling is outgoing and confident. 
                She has recently learned to fly, and she loves flying more than anything, even though she can only get about 4 or 5 feet off the ground. 
                Ming-Ming enjoys being the center of attention, can sometimes be overzealous, and often gets ahead of herself, which provides comic relief in the show. 
                Ming-Ming represents the developmental age of a three-year-old.                                        </p>
